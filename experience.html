        <h4>Challenges faced</h4>
        <b>Initial challenges</b><br><br>
                The first challenge I faced was simply getting used to working at a large tech company like Amazon. Being my first internship, it took me a bit to get used
                to the day-to-day workflow. The second challenge I faced was understanding the base goals of my project. Since it required me to interact
                with so many different services, each with their different purposes, I spent quite a while reading wikis and documentation in my first few weeks.
                The third challenge I faced was regarding my choice of development laptop. Since my entire team used Macbooks for their work and 
                I had chosen a Windows laptop, I faced a whole array of setup issues which I needed to fix independently.
        <br><br>
        <b>Techincal challenges</b><br><br>
        <!-- ul of challenges -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>Challenge:</b> The first technical challenge I faced was getting one of the servies I was modifying to build after introducing a change
                to one of the packages. Without the change, the service would build, but with it, the build would break. I spent a lot of time
                looking at wikis, similar scenarios other Amazonians had dealt with, and asking questions to my mentor and other teammates <br><br>
                <b>Solution:</b> After talking to another intern who had a similar issue, I first realized that there was an issue with the
                package versions I was using. After completely restarting my workspace from scratch, the fix for the issue was to pull in
                a problematic package locally to prevent conflicting builds. <br><br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Challenge:</b> The second technical challenge was having 2 or more locally-running services to call each other. These services
                are configured to call the beta versions of the services they are dependent on, not locally-running instances. Normally,
                it would be a simple configuration change, but since one of the services was running in a Docker container, configuring
                the correct host/port became more diffucult.<br><br>
                <b>Solution:</b> The service that was running in the Docker container needed to use the static IP address of the development
                machine the other service was running on when making its service calls. Using the common host name and relying on DNS resolution 
                did not work due to dynamic IP addressing.<br><br>
