			<h4>MicroManager School Planner</h4>
			<article>
				For virtual CodeDay, which occured in August 2020,
				my team made an Android app that manages a student's
				assignments in school. The student would be able to
				add assignments, view them, mark them as done, set
				their priority, and keep track of them overall.
				My team had decided to make this project due to COVID-19
				and online school, which made it difficult to keep track
				of everything. Some challenges we encountered while making
				this project were that we were relatively new to databases
				and multiple other components of app devlepment such as lifecyles,
				layouts, etc. This made this project a very big learning curve, but
				it was a great way of obtaining knowledge about app development.

			<h4>Uno game</h4>
			<article>
				This project was a recreation of the card game UNO. It
				was split into two versions over two time periods. Both versions were also
				created during two separate CodeDay hackathons. The first
				one was a text-based version written in Java in which my team and I had 24 hours to
				create a project. It was very difficult for us as none of us had taken any programming courses,
				but we managed to create a working version of UNO in which the user could play against a computer.
				We also managed to win a prize with the cateogry of "Coding Excellence" for our game. The second
				version of this project was during a different virtual CodeDay, where we took our text-based game
				further by making it into an Android app. We were completely new to Android Studio at the time, so it
				was difficult for us to get started, but it ended up being a very fun project as we saw out text-based game
				turn into one with a UI.

			<h4>Personal Webpage</h4>
			<article>
				This project was creating a personal website for myself, which you are viewing right now! It was my first real dive
				into HTML and CSS, giving me lots of insight on how to create webpages. I learned about responsive web design, different
				HTML elements, CSS properties and styling, and more. It was also a good venue for displaying things about me and what
				projects I have worked on.

			<h4>Dhikr App</h4>
			<article>
				This project was a religious tool app made on Android Studio. Many of my family members and friends
				constantly reported not having a good and reliable app for Dhikr, which is the remembrance
				of God. Thus, I created this Android app which counts and stores how much Dhikr the user has done,
				along with providing references to different types of Dhikr. This app was also where I started getting familiar
				with data storage, as I used SharedPreferences to store the user's amount of Dhikr. A big challenge for me was
				actually publishing the app to the Play Store, as it was a completely new concept. This app also got me excited
				about app development as I saw the effect my app was having on people.
