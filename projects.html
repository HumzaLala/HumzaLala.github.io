			<h4>MicroManager School Planner</h4>
			<article>
				For virtual CodeDay, which occured in August 2020,
				my team made an Android app that manages a student's
				assignments in school. The student would be able to
				add assignments, view them, mark them as done, set
				their priority, and keep track of them overall.
				My team had decided to make this project due to COVID-19
				and online school, which made it difficult to keep track
				of everything. Some challenges we encountered while making
				this project were that we were relatively new to databases
				and multiple other components of app devlepment such as lifecyles,
				layouts, etc. This made this project a very big learning curve, but
				it was a great way of obtaining knowledge about app development.
				<strong>*UPDATE* The published version of this app is available for download. 
				(Credit to one of my teammates, Safwaan Taher, for publishing the finished version).</strong>

			<h4>Uno game</h4>
			<article>
				This project was a recreation of the card game UNO. It
				was split into two versions over two time periods. Both versions were also
				created during two separate CodeDay hackathons. The first
				one was a text-based version written in Java in which my team and I had 24 hours to
				create a project. It was very difficult for us as none of us had taken any programming courses,
				but we managed to create a working version of UNO in which the user could play against a computer.
				We also managed to win a prize in the cateogry of "Coding Excellence" for our game. The second
				version of this project was during a different virtual CodeDay, where we took our text-based game
				further by making it into an Android app. We were completely new to Android Studio at the time, so it
				was difficult for us to get started, but it ended up being a very fun project as we saw out text-based game
				turn into one with a UI.

			<h4>Personal Webpage</h4>
			<article>
				This project was creating a personal website for myself, which you are viewing right now! It was my first real dive
				into HTML and CSS, giving me lots of insight on how to create webpages. I learned about responsive web design, different
				HTML elements, CSS properties and styling, and more. It was also a good venue for displaying things about me and what
				projects I have worked on.

			<h4>Dhikr App</h4>
			<article>
				This project was a religious tool app made on Android Studio. Many of my family members and friends
				constantly reported not having a good and reliable app for Dhikr, which is a form of meditation. Thus, I created
				this Android app which captures the quantity and type of meditation the user has done,
				along with providing references to different types of meditation. This app was also where I started getting familiar
				with data storage, as I used SharedPreferences to store the user's amount of Dhikr. A big challenge for me was
				actually publishing the app to the Play Store, as it was a completely new concept for me. This app also got me excited
				about app development as I saw the effect my app was having on people.

			<h4>House Scout</h4>
			<article>
				For Dubhacks 2020 at the University of Washington, my team and I created a web-scraper Android app that found houses for the
				user based on the zipcode they entered. If the user likes a house, they can click on a link to take them to an area
				where they can contact the seller. To help aid the user in their decision, they can click on the image of a house
				to show certain metrics about the area (based on the zipcode), such as the school test scores, median income, average
				commute time, and unemployment rate. The user can also create an account with their email, which is stored in a FireBase
				database. We created this app using Android and Jsoup as the HTML parser. Some challenges my team and I encountered while
				creating this app were that we had to learn about Threads and the AsyncTask when making the app, which was completely new to us.
				We also had to naviagte through the webpages we scraped information from, so we had to get familiar with the webpages' layout.
				Overall, this was a very fun project to create and I learned a lot from it.
