			<h4>MicroManager School Planner</h4>
			<article>
				For virtual CodeDay, which occured in August 2020,
				my team made an Android app that manages a student's
				assignments in school. The student would be able to
				add assignments, view them, mark them as done, set
				their priority, and keep track of them overall.
				My team had decided to make this project due to COVID-19
				and online school, which made it difficult to keep track
				of everything. Some challenges we encountered while making
				this project were that we were relatively new to databases
				and multiple other components of app devlepment such as lifecyles,
				layouts, etc. This made this project a very big learning curve, but
				it was a great way of obtaining knowledge about app development.

			<h4>Uno game</h4>
			<article>
				This project was a recreation of the card game UNO. It
				was split into two versions over two time periods. Both versions were also
				created during two separate CodeDay hackathons. The first
				one was a text-based version written in Java in which my team and I had 24 hours to
				create a project. It was very difficult for us as none of us had taken any programming courses,
				but we managed to create a working version of UNO in which the user could play against a computer.
				We also managed to win a prize with the cateogry of "Coding Excellence" for our game. The second
				version of this project was during a different virtual CodeDay, where we took our text-based game
				further by making it into an Android app. We were completely new to Android Studio at the time, so it
				was difficult for us to get started, but it ended up being a very fun project as we saw out text-based game
				turn into one with a UI.
